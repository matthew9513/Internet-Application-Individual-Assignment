<p>
    For starters, you would need the components of a desktop which main component includes the processor, motherboard,
    RAM, graphics card if for gaming/video editing, storage(SSD & HDD), casing and a power supply. There will be quick
    links listed
    down below for easier reference.

<h2><a id="step1">1. Picking your components</a></h2>
<p>Many people would ask what parts to choose. Of course, you have to create a budget for the parts that you want to buy
    first. After that, you can survey at sites like <a class="details" href="https://pcpartpicker.com/">PCPartPicker</a>
    to get an idea and guide on what to buy for your build. A little tip on picking a power supply is no matter how
    cheap your budget
    is, you cannot save for a power supply. It is better to save up some money in order to afford at least a Bronze tier
    80+ efficiency power supply since the power supply is the most important part of your PC build. Getting a good power
    supply also unlocks upgrading capabilities for the prior future.</p>

<h2><a id="step2">2. Putting together the components </a></h2>
<p>After waiting for all the parts to be shipped from online or getting the parts from nearby retailers, it is time for
    the fun part which is assembling your PC. Start by sorting all the parts accordingly starting from motherboard,
    processor, RAM and m.2 SSD if you bought any. These will be the parts where you will have to assemble first before
    placing it into the casing.</p>

<h2><a id="step3">3. Assembling your processor,RAM and m.2 SSD onto your motherboard</a></h2>
<p>First, go ahead and find the CPU socket on your motherboard. You can't miss it - look for the large square socket
    somewhere near the middle of your motherboard that has a little metal lever alongside it. After that, you need to
    first lift up the retention arm to open up the CPU socket on the motherboard and then lift the arm up all the way,
    and then open up the socket cover. Only Intel CPU sockets have covers - AMD sockets do not. Before picking up your
    CPU, first look closely at the CPU socket and look for the triangle mark/icon in the bottom left corner. This
    indicates which way to install your CPU, as there will be an arrow on the CPU itself that goes in this corner.
    Gently place the processor onto the socket and then lock the CPU socket by lowering the retention arm and clip it
    back to the hook. All processors will have a heatsink fan included in the packaging and the guide for installing
    will be right here > <a class="details"
        href="https://www.build-gaming-computers.com/how-to-install-cpu-cooler.html">Click here.</a> As for the RAM and
    m.2 SSD, if you are only using 1 RAM stick, look into the motherboard user manual to locate which slot to fit it
    into. Just unlock the RAM slot by pressing down the small clip located at the edges of the RAM slot, after that just
    insert the RAM following the shape of the RAM and the slot as there is only one way to fit the RAM in, when the RAM
    is inserted correctly, there will be a click sound after installing them. For the m.2 SSD if you have one, you can
    locate the m.2 slot on the motherboard by checking the motherboard user manual if you are not sure, and just insert
    the m.2 SSD when you found the slot and it is similarly to installing the RAM except you will have to screw the m.2
    SSD onto the motherboard.</p>
